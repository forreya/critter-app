# Critter Photo-Sharing App

This app was initially supposed to be a twitter-clone but ended up steering into a different direction as I developed the app. 
The final product is a photo sharing app, similar to instagram, where users can sign-up, log-in, post **chirps**, and view other people's **chirps**.

Specifications:
